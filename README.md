- 👋 Hi all, I’m @IJR.
- 👀 I have a strong passion and interest in almost all things Info Tech/Cyber security field and always wanted to know my way around Python.
- 🌱 I have a background in CySec with some certs and courses to my name but my learning path at this moment is currently on Amazon Web Services (CP and SA), with a long term view on Security. At this moment I have basic Linux and Python skills but they're improving every month.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with new people from all levels but especially those new working on their Linux and Python skills.
- 📫 You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ithan-remy-602a181a1/
