- 👋 Hi all, I’m @Ym3r.
- 👀 I have a strong passion in learning about Cloud Technology, DevOps and Python.
- 🌱 I have a few certs and courses to my name but my learning path at this moment is currently centred arround Cloud Technology and DevOps tools and methodologies. At this moment I have "okay" Linux and Python skills but they're improving every month.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with new people from all levels but especially those new working on improving their Python skills or knowledge on cloud computing and devops.
